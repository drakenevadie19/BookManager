# BookManager
Guided Dr. Sarka in TCU, I developed a database system for managing new books coming for TCU, using Python and MySQL. This database can also handle queries such as searching for a book/books, changing books' information, and deleting books. For IDE, I used Pycharm for Python and Datagrip, with Docker to monitor the database.
