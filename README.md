# BookManager
Guided Dr. Sarka in TCU, I developed a database system for managing new books coming for TCU, using Python and MySQL. This database can also handle queries such as searching a book/books, changing books' information, deleting books. For IDE, I used Pycharm for Python and Datagrip, with Docker to monitor database.

- Techstack:
  - Language: MySQL, Python.
  - Application: Pycharm, Datagrip, Docker.
